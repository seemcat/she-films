            <div class="text-content">
                <ul>
                    <li>this is the foundation. we meet every sunday at 7am PT for 10 weeks</li>
                    <li>if you can't make it and you let me know ahead of time, we can figure it out</li>
                    <li>if you ghost without saying anything, that tells me you're not ready for this level of commitment</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>you're not here to do everything. you're here to do ONE thing consistently</li>
                    <li>pick one platform to focus on for the season. you can repost elsewhere, but this is your priority</li>
                    <li>your output habit = what you're posting (ex: 1 youtube video per week)</li>
                    <li>your process habit = how you're making it happen (ex: edit for 1 hour every tuesday at 7pm)</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>this is our core value. we're not here to plan forever. we're here to ship</li>
                    <li>messy > missing. done > perfect</li>
                    <li>if you're overthinking, you're not posting. and if you're not posting, you're not building the muscle</li>

                    <li>every wednesday, you check in with each other — how's it going, did you post, do you need support</li>
                    <li>this isn't optional. this is how we stay accountable between sundays</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>if you miss posting 3 weeks, you're out of season 2</li>
                    <li>BUT — your strikes reset if you adjust to a more realistic goal and hit it for 2 weeks straight</li>
                    <li>this isn't about punishment. it's about being honest with yourself</li>
                    <li>if your goal is too ambitious and you keep missing, the answer isn't to beat yourself up. it's to make it easier and rebuild the streak</li>
                    <li>the point is to stay in the game. lower the bar if you need to — just don't stop showing up</li>
                    <li>if you're struggling, talk to me before you hit 3 strikes. we'll figure it out together</li>
