                <p>you have 5,000+ videos and photos you'll "edit later." ideas that never make it out of your notes app. deadlines you keep missing.</p>

                <p>every sunday we show up to become the type of person who creates and posts.</p>
                <p>we reflect on last week, prep for the upcoming week, and commit to one clear goal.</p>
                <p>one goal. one platform. then you execute.</p>
                <p class="commitment-header">the commitment:</p>
                <ul class="commitment-list">
                    <li>• show up every sunday</li>

                    <li>• follow through on your weekly goals</li>
