                <br>this is where the magic happens — in the messy middle of your week.</br>
                <br>you do your process habit. you edit. you film. you write. you sit down even when you don't feel like it.</br>
                <br>every time you do, log it in proof of habit. this is your receipt. your proof that you're becoming her.</br>

            <h2><b>wednesday: </b>check in with your bestie</h2>
            <div class="text-content">
                <br>midweek is when motivation dips. that's why you have an accountability bestie.</br>
                every wednesday, you check in with each other. it can be a quick message:</br>
                <br><i>"hey, how's it going? did you hit your process habit this week? do you need anything?"</i></br>
                <br>this isn't about judgment. it's about staying in the game together.</br>

                <br>your output habit is your weekly commitment. the thing that goes live.</br>
                <br>before we meet on sunday, you should have posted. one reel. one video. one essay.</br>
                <br>whatever your commitment is — ship it, and submit it on poh.</br>
                <br>if you didn't post, be honest about why. we'll figure it out together.</br>

            <div class="text-content">
                <br>every sunday at 7am PT, we come together for one hour.</br>
                <br>we reflect on the past week — what worked, what didn't, what got in the way.</br>
                <br>we adjust if we need to — maybe your goal was too ambitious, maybe life happened.</br>
                <br>we plan for the upcoming week — what are you posting? when are you working on it?</br>
                <br>and then we do it all again.</br>
